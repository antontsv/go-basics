# GO basics

This repository has all-in-one `main.go` that demos basic data structures, syntax, style and features of go programming language 1.x

```sh
# if you want to run it (to make sure it all valid)
go run main.go
```

you can also try a version in [Go playground](https://go.dev/play/p/7AhqDGdC9D5)

## Reasons

I switch between different languages often.

Main reason I have created this file is to serve as a quick refresher or cheatsheet for go.

Most high-level languages have similar features: variables, common datatypes, conditional statements, loops, functions.

Yes, there are a ton of cheat sheets in existence:
- some are just lacking examples
- others describe each piece on separate page (just to show ads)
- some are way too long

This is format I believe represent top 95% things I use when writing go code.
